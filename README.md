# ü§ñ Fair Play Kit: Provably Fair Gaming Primitives for Algorand
The Fair Play Kit is a comprehensive, open-source toolkit designed to help developers quickly build transparent and trustless games on the Algorand blockchain. It provides the essential primitives for secure player matching, move submission, and verifiable game resolution.

## üåü Features & Why Use It
- **Trustless by Design**: Eliminates the need for centralized trust. All game logic, state management, and resolution are handled by smart contracts.
- **Dynamic Matchmaking**: Implements a lobby-style system where players can create a match and share a unique ID for an opponent to join.
- **Commit-Reveal Fairness**: Utilizes the Commit-Reveal scheme to ensure both players hide their moves until both are committed, preventing cheating or information leakage.
- **Algorand Boxes for State**: Uses Algorand's Box storage to manage individual match state efficiently, supporting multiple concurrent games.

## üèóÔ∏è How It's Built
The project is structured into three main components that communicate securely:

1. **Smart Contract (`fair_play.py`)**: The immutable backend logic, written in PyTeal.
   - Manages the global `match_counter` to generate dynamic match IDs.
   - Creates and updates individual match state within dedicated Algorand Boxes (192 Bytes).
   - Enforces the game rules, verifies committed moves, and handles match resolution.

2. **SDK (`fairplay.js`)**: The core communication layer, written in pure JavaScript/TypeScript.
   - Handles transaction construction, including predicting the `nextMatchId` and generating dynamic Box References for every transaction.
   - Provides simple, chain-agnostic function calls (e.g., `createMatch`, `joinMatch`).

3. **Frontend (`game-demo.tsx`)**: A React application demonstrating the full workflow.
   - Uses the `@txnlab/use-wallet-react` hook to handle secure transaction signing.
   - Implements polling logic to check the blockchain every few seconds for changes (e.g., detecting when an opponent has joined).

## üöÄ Quick Start (Integrating the Kit)

To integrate the Fair Play Kit into your own Algorand dApp, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+) for JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- Python 3 (with PyTeal and Algorand SDK installed) for smart contract development/deployment
- An Algorand TestNet Wallet (e.g., Pera Wallet) with some test ALGOs for testing.

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract

First, you need to compile and deploy the `fair_play.py` smart contract to the Algorand TestNet. This will give you the App ID required by the SDK.

```bash
# 1. Compile the PyTeal to TEAL
python fair_play.py

# 2. Deploy the contract using your deployment script (e.g., deploy.py)
#    Make sure your deploy.py script outputs the App ID.
python deploy.py

# **IMPORTANT**: Copy the new App ID outputted by your deployment script.
#                This APP_ID is crucial for initializing the SDK.
#                (Example: App ID: 1234567)
```

### 2. Get the Fair Play Kit SDK

You have two options to get the SDK into your project:

#### Option A: Clone from GitHub (For direct integration/development)

If you want to integrate the SDK source directly into your project or contribute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOGESH9139/fair-play-kit/fair-play-module
# Then, you would copy the 'fair-play-module' folder into your project.
```

#### Option B: Install from npm (For package-based integration)

```bash
cd sdk
npm install fair-play-sdk
```

### 3. Use the SDK in Your Application

Now you can import the FairPlaySDK and start interacting with your deployed smart contract.

```javascript
// If you cloned from GitHub and copied the folder (e.g., into a 'src/modules' directory)
import FairPlaySDK from './src/modules/fair-play-module/sdk'; 

// If you installed via npm
// import FairPlaySDK from 'fair-play-sdk';

// Replace with your actual deployed App ID
const APP_ID = 1234567; 
const ALGOD_TOKEN = ""; // Your Algorand API token (e.g., "a".repeat(64) for AlgoNode)
const ALGOD_SERVER = "https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud"; // Your Algorand API server
const ALGOD_PORT = ""; // Port, often empty for HTTPS

const sdk = new FairPlaySDK(APP_ID, ALGOD_TOKEN, ALGOD_SERVER, ALGOD_PORT);

// Example: Creating a new match
async function createNewGame(senderAddress, betAmount) {
  try {
    // Crucial: Predict the next Match ID by reading the global counter
    const globalState = await sdk.getGlobalState();
    const currentMatchCounter = globalState.get("match_counter") || 0;
    const nextMatchId = currentMatchCounter + 1;

    console.log(`Preparing to create Match ID: ${nextMatchId}`);

    const unsignedTxns = await sdk.createMatch(
      senderAddress,
      betAmount,
      nextMatchId
    );

    // You would then use a wallet (e.g., Pera Wallet, AlgoSigner)
    // to sign and send these transactions.
    // Example (using a generic sign/send function from a wallet hook):
    // const signedTxns = await wallet.signTransactions(unsignedTxns);
    // const txId = await algodClient.sendRawTransaction(signedTxns).do();
    // await algosdk.waitForConfirmation(algodClient, txId, 4);

    console.log(`Match ${nextMatchId} creation transaction prepared.`);
    return nextMatchId;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to create match:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Call this function with a connected wallet's address and desired bet
// createNewGame("YOUR_CONNECTED_WALLET_ADDRESS", 100000); // Example: 100000 microAlgos
```
